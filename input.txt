# COMMAND is internal GRoT> command and should not be changed.
# SETTINGS are entered by the user - hints are written in commented line above body of input file.

#
# Input file COMMANDS guide below
#
# --- project --- Project name. 
#                 Directory of this name will be created in "results/" folder, where graphical results files will be stored.
# --- problem --- State of the problem. Possible SETTINGS: planestress, planestrain.
# --- bmp     --- Bitmap model file name - this file have to be stored in "projects/" directory first.
# --- mat     --- Material selection. Possible SETTINGS: steel, alu, titan.
#                 One can easily add new materials in "mlib.py" file in GRoT> directory.
# --- unit    --- Dimension unit of model. Possible SETTINGS: nm, um, mm, cm, dm, m, km.
# --- scale   --- Scale of the model. Multiplies default bitmap model unit dimension by scalar. 
#                 For example: 20 px width in bitmap can be 40 mm in computational model with scale 2.
# --- thickness - Thickness of model. Unit is the same as entered in unit COMMAND.
# --- load    --- Force applied to appropriate boundary color. X is horizontal direction, Y is vertical.
# --- solver  --- Solver selection. Possible SETTINGS: direct, lsqs. Lsqs is iterative least square method solver.
# --- disp    --- Displacements results selection. Possible SETTINGS: x, y, mag. 
#                 That is displacement in X axis, Y axis and magnitude.
# --- stress  --- Stress and strains results selection. 
#                   Possible SETTINGS:
#                   eps_x, eps_y, gamma_xy, sig_x, sig_y, tau_xy, huber, sign_huber.
#                   eps_x, eps_y, gamma_xy - Strains in X direction, strains in Y direction, shear strains
#                   sig_x, sig_y, tau_xy - Stress in X direction, stress in Y direction, shear stress
#                   sig_1, sig_2, tau_max - First principal stress, second principal stress, maximum shear stress
#                   eps_1, eps_2, gamma_max - First principal strain, second principal strain, maximum shear strain
#                   huber, sign_huber, eff_strain - Huber equivalent stress, signed huber equivalent stress, effective strain
#                   theta, inv_1, inv_2 - Principal stress orientation angle, first and second invariant of stress tensor
# --- deformed -- Plot of deformed model. 
#                 Number is deformation scale multiplier, where 1 is equal to standard nodal dimension between two nodes.
