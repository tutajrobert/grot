Linear FEM solver with nonlinear plasticity and postprocessor for strength analysis of 4-noded quadrilateral plane stress and strain elements obtained directly from bitmap file.

To run you need to install dependencies with: 
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then just let the magic happen:
```
python3 run.py
```

What's new in 1.4.0:
- Plastcity! Bilinear isotropic hardening material model
- Second order Runge-Kutta algorithm for nonlinear calculations
- Probe function to check results in specified elements
- Principal strains and stresses, principal angles and invariants of tensors
- Huber stress after unloading
- Nice gallery html file with all of the results
- Bug fixes, element tweaking, efficiency improved


Check the example of gallery file:</br>

But first of all write an email to me if you have any questions or just wanna talk about finite elements. I spent three years working with this software and gain some knowledge about finite elements.

Cheers!
