# GRoT> Graficzny Rozwiązywacz Tarcz
Linear FEM solver with nonlinear plasticity and postprocessor for strength analysis of 4-noded quadrilateral plane stress and strain elements obtained directly from bitmap file.


What's new in 1.4.0:


Plastcity! Bilinear isotropic hardening material model

Second order Runge-Kutta algorithm for nonlinear calculations

Probe function to check results in specified elements

Principal strains and stresses, principal angles and invariants of tensors

Huber stress after unloading

Nice gallery html file with all of the results

Bug fixes, element tweaking, efficiency improved


Check the example of gallery file:

Check old examples:

And you can check old websites for first release of GRoT>

But first of all write an email to me if you have any questions or just wanna talk about finite elements. I spent three years working with this software and gain some knowledge about finite elements.

Cheers!
